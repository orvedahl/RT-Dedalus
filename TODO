Rayleigh-Taylor Problem
---------------------------------------
	What to explore?
		high resolution
		high Re space

	What/How to analyze?
		are there secondary instabilities?
		do they disappear with resolution?
		do they disappear with reynolds # (and high res)?

---------------------------------------
Kelvin-Helmholtz Problem
---------------------------------------
	What to explore?
		Re space -- from ~1 to ~1e7 (change resolution accordingly)
		Pr space -- from ~1 to ~1e7 (change resolution accordingly)

	What/How to analyze?
		some sort of variance??
		2D FFT??
		size of swirl
		tightness of swirl??
		time to equilibrate: when does it get uniform (variance large)?
			make lots of movies
		does swirl always behave in the same way
